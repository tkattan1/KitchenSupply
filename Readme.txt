The file menu bar gives you three options: you may use the dropdown list to open, save or exit the application. "Save" will update the products file, the customers file and create a receipt for the employee who purchased.

First, start by selecting a name in the combobox. Michael Smith is the only employee. The rest are customers. After selecting the user, click ok. You must click ok in order to use the app. Depending on whether the user is an employee or not, some fields will be enabled or disabled

If the user is an employee and wishes to create a brand new product, the employee may directly type the values of the product in the fields.
If the employee wishes to edit an existing product, the employee should double click on any item in the product list to autopopulate the fields. If the user is an employee, they may not add the item to the cart.They may however, type in the fields to either edit a product. They will have to enter their pin before they proceed with anything.

If the user is a customer, then the user must select an existing product from the product list. They are only allowed to change the quantity they desire to add to the cart. Once satisfied, the customer must click 'add item'. If the customer wishes to delete items from the cart, the user may double click the item in that cart.

At this point, the customer must enter their PIN to proceed to purchase.

The system will recognize if the PIN is correct or not, and will thereafter display the name and current balance of the user. 
Once the user is authenticated, they are able to purchase if they are a customer, which will automatically deduct from their balance. If they are an employee, they are able to add the new product they created, edit an existing one, or delete one from the product List. It will automatically show in the Product list on the left.
